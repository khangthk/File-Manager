## Generating Documentation

This project uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to generate documentation.  
If Doxygen is available on your system,  
You can generate the documentation by running the following command:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Once done, you can open the generated documentation by opening the [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) file in your browser.

This repository has automated workflow via Github Actions. Documentation is auto-generated.  
Disable Actions on your own fork or delete the [workflows](./.github/workflows) folder if you do not want to be billed.  
This is **not my responsiblity.**
